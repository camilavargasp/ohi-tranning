Artisanal Oportunities

1.
a.
PPPpcGDP = 1 --> low porverty, high conomic security
Oao = 1 --> lots of opprotunities
Then the  Status of AO wuld be equal to the sustainable parameter Sao = 1 in the globlas scale

b.
PPPpcGDP = 1
Oao = 0.1 --> Low opportunity
It will also be 1

What does this tell us about this goal?
If there is no need, GDP is high then it dosen't matter what is your need.
or if you have lots of opportunitty it becomes important when the economic scurity is low


```{r}
Du <- (1-1)*(1-0.1)
Xao <- (1-Du)*1
```
