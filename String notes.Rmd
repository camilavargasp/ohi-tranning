Notes from tranning on [this link](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/strings.html)

Following the programing in R trainning we where challenged to go over the `string` manipulation in R.
Let's see how it goes...

#Intoduction
Lean how does strings work
How to create them hand by hand
Focus of the chapter is in regular expresion or regexp

"When you first look at a regexp, youâ€™ll think a cat walked across your keyboard, but as your understanding improves they will soon start to make sense."

What is sting? 
`stringr` Its a package for string manipulation!!

##Prerequisites
What do we need
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(stringr)
```

#String Basics

Use "" to create a string (you can also use '', but is less recomended unless- see below)
```{r}
string1 <- "This is a string"
string2 <- 'If I want to include a "quote" inside a string, I use single quotes'

```
